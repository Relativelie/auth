# Authentication Example

## Project Objective

- The purpose of the project is to demonstrate skills in developing authorization systems.
- It's a simple project for now, but I'll make it more complicated over time.

## Technologies Used

react - refresh/access tokens - Router Dom v6 - react-hook-form - react-toastify

## Features

* Authorization and registration
* Sending requests with an access token
* Refreshing token if access token is not valid
* Email and pass validation

## Backend mocks

Backend mocks are located [here](https://github.com/Relativelie/auth_back). These are just dummy mocks
